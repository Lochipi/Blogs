Let's keep going:

4. #### What are the different ways to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript?

   JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning that two bits of script cannot run at the same time; they have to run one after the other. This can be a problem when you have code that needs to run after something that takes a long time, like a server request. JavaScript handles this problem by using `callbacks`, `promises`, and `async/await`.

   - `Callbacks`: A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing. Here's an example of a callback function:

```javascript
function getData(data, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Retrieved data:", data);
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

function showData() {
  console.log("Data has been shown.");
}

getData(10, showData);
```

In this example, `showData` is the callback function. The `getData` function will run first, and once it's done, it will call the `showData` function.

- `Promises`: A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: **fulfilled**, **rejected**, or **pending**. Here's an example of a promise:

```javascript
function getData(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (typeof data === "number") {
        resolve(data * 2);
      } else {
        reject("Number must be provided");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

getData(10)
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Data:", data);
    return getData(20);
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Data:", data);
    return getData("30");
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Error:", error);
  });
```

In this example, the `getData` function returns a promise. If the promise is resolved, the `then` method will be called, and if it's rejected, the `catch` method will be called.

- `Async/Await`: The `async/await` feature is built on top of promises. It's syntax sugar that makes promises easier to work with. Here's an example of `async/await`:

```javascript
function getData(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (typeof data === "number") {
        resolve(data * 2);
      } else {
        reject("Number must be provided");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data1 = await getData(10);
    console.log("Data:", data1);
    const data2 = await getData(20);
    console.log("Data:", data2);
    const data3 = await getData("30");
    console.log("Data:", data3);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is an `async` function that uses the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to be resolved. If the promise is resolved, the value is returned. If the promise is rejected, an error is thrown.

5. #### What is event delegation in JavaScript?

   `Event delegation` is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of using event delegation are:

   - Memory footprint goes down because only one event handler is needed on the parent element, rather than multiple event handlers on multiple child elements.
   - There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.

   Here's an example of event delegation:

```html
<ul id="parent-list">
  <li id="item-1">Item 1</li>
  <li id="item-2">Item 2</li>
  <li id="item-3">Item 3</li>
  <li id="item-4">Item 4</li>
  <li id="item-5">Item 5</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById("parent-list").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  if (e.target && e.target.nodeName === "LI") {
    console.log(
      "List item ",
      e.target.id.replace("item-", ""),
      " was clicked!"
    );
  }
});
```

In this example, a single event listener is added to the parent `<ul>` element. When a `<li>` element is clicked, the event bubbles up to the parent `<ul>` element, and the event listener handles the event.

6. #### How do you handle errors in JavaScript?

   Errors in JavaScript can be handled using `try...catch` blocks. The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors, and the `catch` block lets you handle the error. Here's an example:

```javascript
try {
  // Code to test for errors
  throw new Error("This is an error");
} catch (e) {
  // Code to handle the error
  console.log(e);
}
```

In this example, the `try` block contains code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the `catch` block will catch it and handle it. The `catch` block takes an error object as a parameter, which can be used to get information about the error.

7. #### How do you check the type of a variable in JavaScript?

   You can check the type of a variable in JavaScript using the `typeof` operator. The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. Here are some examples:

```javascript
typeof 42; // "number"
typeof "hello"; // "string"
typeof true; // "boolean"
typeof undefined; // "undefined"
typeof null; // "object"
typeof {}; // "object"
typeof []; // "object"
typeof function () {}; // "function"
```

The `typeof` operator is useful for checking the type of a variable before performing operations on it that might not be valid for certain types.

8. #### How do you convert a string to a number in JavaScript?

   You can convert a string to a number in JavaScript using the `parseInt` or `parseFloat` functions. The `parseInt` function parses a string and returns an integer, while the `parseFloat` function parses a string and returns a floating-point number. Here are some examples:

```javascript
parseInt("42"); // 42
parseFloat("3.14"); // 3.14
```

you should note that `parseInt` and `parseFloat` will return `NaN` (Not a Number) if the string cannot be converted to a number.

9. #### Explain the concept of scope in JavaScript.

   `Scope` in JavaScript refers to the visibility of variables. There are two types of scope in JavaScript: `global scope` and `local scope`.

   - `Global scope`: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the code.

   - `Local scope`: Variables declared inside a function have local scope and can only be accessed and modified within that function.

   Here's an example of scope in JavaScript:

```javascript
let globalVariable = "I'm a global variable";

function myFunction() {
  let localVariable = "I'm a local variable";
  console.log(globalVariable); // Output: I'm a global variable
  console.log(localVariable); // Output: I'm a local variable
}

console.log(globalVariable); // Output: I'm a global variable
```

In this example, `globalVariable` has global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code. `localVariable` has local scope and can only be accessed within the `myFunction` function.
