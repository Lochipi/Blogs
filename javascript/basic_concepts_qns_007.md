## Async Programming

This is a new chapter, we will be discussing about async programming in JavaScript. This is a very important concept to understand, as it is used in many places in JavaScript.

### What is async programming?

Async programming is a way of writing code that allows the program to run without waiting for the previous code to finish. This is done by using asynchronous functions, which are functions that return a promise.

### yes, what is a promise?

A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

### How do you create a promise?

You can create a promise using the `Promise` constructor. The constructor takes a function as an argument, which takes two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`. The `resolve` function is called when the promise is fulfilled, and the `reject` function is called when the promise is rejected.

### Can you give an example of a promise? You may ask.

Sure, here is an example of a promise that resolves after 1 second:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("resolved");
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value); // 'resolved'
});
```

In the above example, the promise resolves after 1 second, and the `then` method is called with the resolved value.

### What is the difference between async/await and promises?

Async/await is a syntactic sugar for promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. It makes the code easier to read and write.

### Can you give an example of async/await?

Sure, here is an example of async/await that resolves after 1 second:

```javascript
const delay = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

const asyncFunction = async () => {
  await delay(1000);
  console.log("resolved");
};

asyncFunction();
```

In the above example, the `delay` function returns a promise that resolves after the given time. The `asyncFunction` function uses the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve.

### What is a callback function in JavaScript?

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is executed after the other function has finished executing. Callback functions are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

example:

```javascript
const fetchData = (url, callback) => {
  fetch(url)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => callback(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
};

fetchData("https://api.example.com/data", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

In the above example, the `fetchData` function takes a URL and a callback function as arguments. The callback function is executed after the data is fetched from the URL.

### What is the event loop in JavaScript?

The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows the program to run asynchronously. It is responsible for handling events, such as user input, timers, and network requests.

### How do you handle HTTP requests in JavaScript?

You can handle HTTP requests in JavaScript using the `fetch` API. The `fetch` API is a modern replacement for the `XMLHttpRequest` object, and provides a more powerful and flexible way to make HTTP requests.

example:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### How do you handle time intervals in JavaScript?

You can handle time intervals in JavaScript using the `setInterval` function. The `setInterval` function takes a callback function and a time interval as arguments, and executes the callback function at the specified time interval.

example:

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}, 1000);
```

That;s it for today. We will be diving deeper into advance concepts in the next chapter. Stay tuned!
